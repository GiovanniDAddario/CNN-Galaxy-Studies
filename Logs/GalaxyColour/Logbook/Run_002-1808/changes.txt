Changes from run 1 to 2:
Next big run: made some tweaks based on config of run 26 in Central vs Satellite Reduced, mainly to try an improve
performance in the Central Vs Satellite study rather than in the Colour classification. However, seemed correct
to apply same model here to see what happens.
Tweaked architecture of CNN w.r.t run 1, added lr decay, raised initial lr.
