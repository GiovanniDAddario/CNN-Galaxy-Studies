Galaxy colour classification on larger data set (compared to GalaxyColourClassifier-Reduced) using the model which
performed best on the smaller data set. Key features:
Model with 4 convolutional layers (changes filter size slightly with respect to first efforts found in Central Vs
Satellite study). Added dropout layers with 0.2 dropout rate compared to earlier models.
Relu activations, apart from last layer which has a sigmoid activation perform classification.
Learning rate of adam optimiser set to 1e-5.
20 training epochs.
