Changes from run 2 to run 3:

Commented out all lines with matplotlib functions; print accuracies instead of plotting them.
Removed one pooling and one 2D conv layers : this meant that there were too many parameters to fit,
	causing the memory error seen in nohup.out file (i think).
Did not attempt the unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH command before running
