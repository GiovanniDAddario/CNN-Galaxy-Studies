Changes from run 6 to 7:
Run 6 had to be interrupted for excessive memory consumption. Therefore, now not running a Galaxy colour classification
at the same time; also removed lr decay as that seemed to really slow down the process. Have changed architecture
slightly (lr, dropout rate, filter sizes) to match run 28 in central vs satellite reduced.
