Changes from run 4 to 5:
Long time since last run in this study; more progress has been made in the '-Reduced' directory of this study and
in the Galaxy Colour classification studies (mainly in the '-Reduced' directory again).
Info of this run; now have cnn model outside of training script.
Have set this up in same way as Run_001-1708 of GalaxyColourClassifier; only difference is that there I used 'Adam' 
optimizer, here used 'SGD'. IMPORTANT - given than Adam had given results for colour, decided to terminate run and
set it off again with Adam optimiser. See cnn.py for architecture.
