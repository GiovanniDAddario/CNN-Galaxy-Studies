Change from run 28 to run 29:
Not sure if tweaked cnn architecture wrt last run, check cnn.py.
Set a batch size of 128 in training to see if it had any effects; no apparent improvement in performance
but greater consumption of RAM so not great.
Ignore last part of nohup.out, accidentally ran script here.
